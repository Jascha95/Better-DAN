Pumpkin Pie Recipe

Ingredients:
For the Pumpkin Pie:
19-inch Homemade pie crust , or store-bought, deep dish, unbaked
150 g granulated sugar
3 g ground cinnamon
3 g salt
1 g ground ginger
0.6 g ground cloves
2 large eggs
15 ounce can canned pumpkin or fresh pumpkin puree
12 ounce can evaporated milk

For the Caramel Pecan Topping: 
1/2 cup light brown sugar, packed
2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream
1 tablespoon light corn syrup
1 tablespoon butter
1/2 cup chopped pecans
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

How it's done:
Pumpkin Pie:
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. 
In a large bowl beat the eggs and pumpkin together. In a separate bowl, combine the sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger and cloves, and add to pumpkin mixture.
Gradually stir in the evaporated milk. Carefully pour mixture into unbaked pie shell. 
Bake at 425 degrees F for for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350Â° F; bake for 40 to 50 minutes longer, or until the pie is set. Check for doneness by giving the pie a gentle wiggle. The center may jiggle just a tiny bit. It will continue to set up as it cools. Or, it is done when a sharp knife inserted in center comes out clean.
Cool completely on a wire cooling rack. Serve immediately with whipped cream and caramel pecan topping, if desired.

Topping: 
Add brown sugar, cream, corn syrup, and butter to a small saucepan over medium high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for about 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
Remove from heat and stir in chopped pecans and vanilla. The topping will thicken as it cools. Spoon topping over cooled pumpkin pie slices and top with whipped cream.
