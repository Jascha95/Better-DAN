  <h2>Sights</h2>
  <div class="sights">
  <h3>The Cathedral</h3> 
    <p>
        <img src="images/cathedral.jpg">
    The "Münster Unserer Lieben Frau"
    (Cathedral of our Beloved Lady) was modeled after the Minster
    in Basel. Work began around 1200 on the site of an old parish
    church from the 12th century. The choir, the Late Romanesque
    transom, the nave and the flanking towers were completed before
    the death of the last Zähringer duke, Bertold V (1218).  In
    1220, the plans were revised and construction continued in the
    Modern Gothic style, which at that time had reached its zenith
    in France.  The west tower - the "most beautiful tower of
    Christianity"- was finished in 1330. Cathedral reached
    completion.  It is likely that the new building of the Late
    Gothic chancel was designed by the cathedral master workman
    Johannes von Gmünd. The cornerstone was laid in 1354. The
    chancel was not fully finished until 1513, due to political and
    economic problems in the city and poor management.  The
    Cathedral achieved its present form at the beginning of the 16th
    century.  If you have the guts to climb the Cathedral tower,
    you'll be rewarded with a breathtaking view.
    </p>

    <h3>Kornhaus</h3> 
      <p>
      <img src="images/kornhaus.jpg"> 
      The "Kornhaus"
      (granary) on the north-west side of the Cathedral Square was
      built in 1498 as a place to hold dances and to store and sell
      grains. In 1944, the Kornhaus was destroyed down to the ground
      walls. It was rebuilt in its original form (1969-71) under the
      direction of the architect Herbert Dörr. Today, the house is an
      arcade with shops, a café, restaurants and office space. The
      main point of interest is the attractive stair-step shaped front
      gable with its attic windows. Formerly, items stored in the
      Kornhaus were heaved out of the storage rooms through these
      windows.
      </p>

    <h3>Historisches Kaufhaus (Historic Merchants' Hall)</h3>
        <p>
        <img src="images/kaufhaus.jpg">
        The "Historisches Kaufhaus" (Historical Merchant Hall) was
        built in the 16th century. It served as the administrative
        headquarters for Freiburg's market, customs, and finance
        offices.  At this time, trade was growing rapidly in the city
        and the duties paid by the merchants who passed through
        Freiburg were an ever-increasing source of
        income. Additionally, the merchant house provided a place to
        store goods.  The Historisches Kaufhaus survived both world
        wars almost undamaged. History has it that on the night of the
        city's bombing in World War II (1944), the landlord from the
        adjacent Weinstube saved the Kaufhaus in an unusual
        manner. Karl Oberkirch extinguished the flying sparks of a
        fire by dousing them with his wine.  Today, the building is
        mostly used for classical music concerts and receptions.
      </p>

      <h3>Martinstor and Schwabentor (two gates)</h3>
      <p>
        <img src="images/gate.jpg">
        The "Martinstor" (Martin's Gate) belongs to Freiburg's first
        city fortifications built at the beginning of the 13th
        century. It is older than the other remaining fortification
        tower gate, the "Schwabentor" (originally there were four
        towers). The Martinstor was joined on the land side to the
        city wall. The defence passage was six meters above the
        ground. A twelve meter wide and five meter deep bridged moat
        was located outside the tower.
      </p>

    <h3>Colombi Palace (Museum of Early and Pre-History)</h3>
      <p>
        <img src="images/colombi.jpg">
        Georg Jakob Schneider built the "Colombischlößle" (Colombi
        Mansion) for the Countess Zea Bermudez y Colombi and her
        daughters between 1859 and 1861. The house is situated on the
        former "Saint Louis" bastion, which was torn down in 1744/45.
        The new "Villa Colombi" was designed in the English Gothic and
        Tudor styles. The Colombi Mansion became the permanent
        property of Freiburg in 1899. Since then, it has served as the
        home of various institutions. From 1947-1952, Land President
        Leo Wohleb ran the Office of the State of Baden from the
        mansion. In 1983, the Colombi Mansion became the site for the
        Museum für Ur- und Frühgeschichte (Museum for Pre- and Early
        history).  The small vineyard which looks out onto the
        Eisenbahnstraße is the remainder of the "Glacis-Reben" (type
        of grapevine) planted in 1745 on the ruins of the Baroque
        fortifications.
      </p>

    <h3>Schlossberg (Fortification Ruins) / Lookout Tower</h3>
      <p>
        <img src="images/schlossberg.jpg">
          The Schlossberg (Castle Hill) in the middle of Freiburg served
          from 1677 to 1744 as a fortress for the French
          conquerors. Today, the hill with its wonderful views over
          Freiburg and Dreisamtal (valley of the River Dreisam) is a
          very popular destination for excursions. Special attractions
          are the 35 meter high, recently newly-built lookout tower and
          the beer garden of the Restaurant Greiffeneggschlössle.

          In the middle of Freiburg's Old Town you will find the
          largest museum of South Baden, the "Augustiner-museum". The
          former cloistral building of the "Augustiner-Eremiten" with
          its Gothic cloister and its high church room creates an
          impressive atmosphere.  With its valuable collection of art
          and culture of the Upper Rhine area, reaching from the
          mediaeval times to the 20th century, the Augustinermuseum is
          of national importance.  Due to some constructional work,
          part of the museum is closed at the moment, but most of the
          collections are nevertheless accessible.

      <h3>Uni-Museum</h3>
      <p>
        In its new location, more than just the history and tradition
        of the University of Freiburg is now presented. The main focus
        is on the research work and teachings from the beginning of
        the 15th century to the present day. As a modern university
        with over 21,000 students, it today covers virtually all areas
        of the Arts, Sciences, Applied Sciences and Medicine. Through
        events, stagings and experiences, a forum has emerged in the
        Uni-Museum where new teaching and learning units can be
        presented and an entertaining dialogue with society, culture
        and business can develop.
