Version 0.1.2
- corrected code that deals with constraints
  of the form:
    tv :=mu tv
  for all mu and for mu = {}.
  Generates only constraints that are 
  necessary and that uses a fixed l \in mu.
  The lower bound of mu is used for that
  purpose now.

Version 0.1.1
- corrected code that normalizes types
- corrected code that deals with constraints 
  of the form:
    tv :=#mu tv
  for the special case, that is equal 
  mu = {}.
